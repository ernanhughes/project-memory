"""Query layer: four resolver conditions + computed/materialized belief.

Conditions:
- T0 bag: ignores all temporal fields (event presence alone).
- T1 arrival: newest by ingest/record order wins (naive baseline).
- T1b event-time: sorted by event_time, last wins (no transitions).
- T2 ordered: event-time order + reducer transition semantics.
- T3 temporal: T2 + valid/record standpoint + effective-time +
  supersession/correction semantics (bitemporal).

The deterministic temporal engine answers mechanical questions with no
LLM. An LLM may later render these answers; it must not reinterpret them.
