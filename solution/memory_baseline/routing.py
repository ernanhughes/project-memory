"""Query routing: historical recall vs present-action influence.

A central empirical result of the book (Chapter 6 Nexus, capstone
``simulator/pipeline.py``): historical recall and present influence
are different optimization problems. Recall asks what the record
says; influence asks what should steer present behavior. Authority
must not erase history: a record denied standing to direct action
may still be legitimate evidence for a recall question
(``tests/test_routing.py::test_recall_route_keeps_preference_q000018``).

This module answers only the routing question — which use the caller
is asking memory to serve. It implements no temporal validity, no
trust admission, no frame policy. Both routes use the same strong
hybrid retriever; what differs is the semantic contract downstream,
which later stages attach to ``RoutingDecision.route``.

Frozen Stage 3 boundary (do not weaken it when adding temporal
resolution): recall preserves historical candidates and does not
suppress superseded evidence merely because it is no longer current.
Influence resolves evidence toward the applicable current state
before it is allowed to steer behaviour. Recall therefore bypasses
*current-state suppression*, not temporal interpretation itself: a
recall question such as "what was true on 11 July" may still require
valid-time/known-time reasoning, while "what did we use before
PostgreSQL" must keep the superseded SQLite evidence available.

The router is deliberately deterministic, cheap, and replaceable:
explicit caller intent wins, then a small documented pattern
function, then an observable ambiguous fallback. No model calls.
